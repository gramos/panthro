Panthro: the rubygems proxy cache
=================================

The idea is to speed up the gem command caching gem and spec files.
Rubygems proxy cache Is a rack app that cache static files into a
local machine, where is runing. Is does not cache /api calls.

Install
=======

```
gem install panthro
panthro --start
```
Once is running you have to point rubygems to this new "mirror"

```
gem sources --add http://localhost:4732
```

And remove rubygems mirror:

```
gem sources --remove http://rubygems.org
```
Then you can start installing gems, and static files like
*.gem *.spec.gz will be cached in ./cache folder.

How it works
============

When you execute for example ```gem install sinatra```
the firsts 2 calls are to https://api.rubygems.org/api/v1/
to get the dependencies of sinatra, then it needs to get the file
sinatra-1.4.5.gemspec.rz and so, you can see the details runing:
```gem install sinatra --verbose```
The first time that you execute this it will download all the files
from rubygems and saved them into the ~/.panthro folder but if you
run ```gem install sinatra``` again from the other machine in the
same net ( obviously you have to add the source with
gem sources --add http://the-proxy-ip:4732 ), it will do all the
https://api.rubygems.org/api/v1/ again, but only these, because it already has
all the other files cached:

```
sinatra-1.4.5.gemspec.rz
tilt-1.4.1.gemspec.rz
tilt-1.4.1.gem
rack-protection-1.5.3.gemspec.rz
rack-protection-1.5.3.gem
sinatra-1.4.5.gem
```

You can use [rumb](http://github.com/gramos/rumb) to test the performance against using 
rubygems.org directly:

```
gem install rumb
rumb rails http://localhost:4732 https://rubygems.org

As you can see it takes 5 seconds using panthro and 20 without it,
obviously it depends on your internet conection.

Similar projects
================

There are other projects that does more or less the same thing,
like [Geminabox proxy support](https://github.com/geminabox/geminabox#rubygems-proxy)
or a regular web proxy like [Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/). I've made this project
as a Learning project and with purpose of keeping as simple and small as I can,
Panthro only does one thing and is to cache gems.
